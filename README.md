As window manager, i use i3wm with i3blocks.  Config of i3wm is in .config/i3 folder. Config of i3blocks is in .config/i3blocks folder. Scripts for i3blocks (scripts for weather, volume, RAM, CPU usage, mpd module and date and time module is in .local/bin folder. Fell fre to modify these).

As fonts (in i3wm, i3blocks and terminals) i use [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) Please install these, acording [instructions](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). Nerd Fonts takes popular programming fonts and adds a bunch of Glyphs. I highly recommend it! üòâ

As color theme i use [Atomic](https://github.com/gerardbm/atomic). Atomic color scheme is already included in terminals, i3wm and cmus.

Fot tmux configuration, please check [this](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)

My default shell is zsh. With it i use [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting). It is Fish shell-like syntax highlighting for Zsh üêü and [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions). It is Fish-like fast/unobtrusive autosuggestions for zsh üê†

Install these plugins from the official repositories.

P.S.

A little explanation about i3blocks modules.

`clock` --Shows time and date. If clicked, brings up calender or coming calcuse events.


`cpu` --Shows CPU temperature. If clicked, shows most processor-intensive processes.


`mem` --Shows memory usage. If clicked, shows most memory-intensive processes.


`mediaplayer` --Shows mpd current song.


`volume` -- Shows volume percentage or mute notification. If clicked, brings up pulsemixer. The pulsemixer (very useful and lightwieght terminal app) not in Debian repos. You can install it with pip command `pip3 install --user pulsemixer`


`weather` --Gets weather forcast from wttr.in and returns today's precipitation chance (‚òî), daily low (snowflake) and daily high (sunny). More info in [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).


Also, i want to say big thanks to opensource community and these guys: [LukeSmithxyz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) and [gerardbm](https://github.com/gerardbm) for they ideasüòÑ
